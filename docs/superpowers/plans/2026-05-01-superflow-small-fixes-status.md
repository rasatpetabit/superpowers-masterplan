## Notes

**Routing decisions for THIS execution run** (documented because they're non-default and a future reader will want to know why):

- **autonomy: loose** — user said "go" as standing approval to proceed without per-task gating. Plan tasks are well-bounded with explicit Edit + grep verification steps; per-task prompting under `gated` would be noise for the user.
- **codex_routing: off** — analysis finding #3 (SDD × Codex routing per-task loop boundary) is unresolved at the time of this run. The spec for THIS pass does NOT modify that boundary. Setting `off` here sidesteps the ambiguity. Future plans (after the boundary is resolved) can use `auto`. Per-task `**Codex:** ok|no` annotations in the plan are still valid documentation — they'll take effect in future runs once the boundary is settled.
- **codex_review: off** — no need for Codex review of self-edits to a docs-heavy plan; the user can review the final diff. Also avoids the asymmetric-review trap (this pass is BEING RUN by Sonnet/Claude under the orchestrator; Codex reviewing would be a fresh perspective, but for a plan that's mostly text edits with grep verification, the value is low).
- **loop_enabled: false** — this session was launched as `/superflow ...`, not `/loop /superflow ...`. ScheduleWakeup is not available; cross-session resumption isn't planned for this pass (small enough to finish in one session).
- **Execution model: inline** — implementer subagents not dispatched per-task. The plan's tasks are mechanical text edits (Edit tool old/new strings spelled out) with grep verification (Bash one-liners). The orchestrator has already loaded the relevant file sections; spinning up 8 subagents would re-load that context per task without benefit. The "Subagents do the work" pillar applies to long runs where orchestrator context bloats — this pass fits comfortably in one session. Inline execution preserves the per-step verification discipline (the plan's grep checks run between each Edit) without overhead.

**Auto-compact nudge** suppressed for this plan — pre-flipped to `compact_loop_recommended: true` since this is a self-edit pass run inline and the user is actively monitoring; a `/loop /compact` sibling session would be unhelpful.

## Wakeup ledger
(empty — no /loop wrapping; cross-session wakeups not used)
