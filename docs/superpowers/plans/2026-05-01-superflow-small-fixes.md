# /superflow Small-Fixes Pass — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Ship six bundled improvements to `commands/superflow.md` (and supporting docs) per `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-01-superflow-small-fixes-design.md`.

**Architecture:** Targeted prompt/text edits inside `commands/superflow.md` plus parallel updates to `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. Each task fixes one finding, ends with a CHANGELOG entry under the right heading, and commits. The final task is a cross-cutting verification pass.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown editing (Edit + Write tools), bash for verification (`grep`, `bash -n`), git for commits. No test runner — this is a Claude Code plugin (markdown commands + skills + one shell hook).

**Verification convention** (used in every task — read this once, then later steps reference it as "verify-grep"):

> After each Edit, run two greps to confirm the change landed:
> 1. `grep -nF '<unique substring of old_string>' <file>` → expect 0 matches.
> 2. `grep -nF '<unique substring of new_string>' <file>` → expect ≥ 1 match.
>
> Pick substrings short enough to be stable, long enough to be unique to that change. Don't grep for words like "task" or "Codex" alone — they appear hundreds of times. Use 6–10-word phrases unique to the edit.

**Spec reference:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-01-superflow-small-fixes-design.md` — re-read the relevant section at the start of each task. Sections in the spec map 1:1 to tasks below.

## Files modified by task

| Task | `commands/superflow.md` | `README.md` | `CHANGELOG.md` | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. SHA fallback fix | Step 4b (~371), arch row (~117), op rules (~755) | — | Fixed | — |
| 2. Step 4a × SDD TDD | Step 4a (~349), arch row (~117), op rules | — | Changed | — |
| 3. Eligibility cache to disk | Step C step 1 (~298), op rule (~770), doctor table (~588) | — | Added | — |
| 4. Plan annotation docs | Step C 3a (~325), Step C 1 builder brief (~298), Step B2 (~248) | new "Plan annotations" subsection | Added | — |
| 5. Gated permissiveness | Step C 3 (~307), Step 4b decision matrix (~392), config schema (~715) | config + flag-combinations table | Changed | — |
| 6. Step B0 trunk warning | Step B0 step 3 (~230) | — | Changed | — |
| 7. Cross-cutting verification | — | — | (final sanity entry) | — |

Each task is independent in scope. Lines shift as edits land — the line numbers above are pre-edit reference points; later tasks should re-read the file to confirm sections before editing.

## Task 1: Fix Step 4b SHA fallback bug; require task_start_sha

**Files:**
- Modify: `commands/superflow.md` — Step 4b process step 1 (~line 371), Subagent dispatch model row for "Step C (per-task implementation)" (~line 117), Operational rules section (~line 755)
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md` — `[Unreleased]` Fixed section

**Codex:** ok    # well-bounded textual edit + grep verification, no design judgment

- [ ] **Step 1: Re-read spec section 1**

Read `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-01-superflow-small-fixes-design.md` lines covering "1. Step 4b SHA fallback fix" to refresh the approach in mind. Concrete change: replace the broken fallback with a protocol-violation blocker; require `task_start_sha` in the implementer's return digest.

- [ ] **Step 2: Replace Step 4b process step 1 fallback text**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the line starting with "1. Compute the task's diff against the **task-start commit SHA**" (currently around line 371). Replace this text:

```
   1. Compute the task's diff against the **task-start commit SHA** captured by the implementer at task start (passed back as part of its return digest). If the implementer didn't record one, fall back to `git merge-base HEAD <branch-of-status>` — but `HEAD~1` is wrong for multi-commit or zero-commit tasks and must NOT be used. If zero commits were made (task aborted before commit), there is no diff to review; skip 4b and let 4a's verification result drive the autonomy policy.
```

With:

```
   1. Compute the task's diff against the **task-start commit SHA** captured by the implementer at task start (passed back as part of its return digest, where it is a **required** field — see the Subagent dispatch model table). If the implementer omitted it, treat as a protocol violation: surface a one-line blocker via `AskUserQuestion` ("Implementer subagent did not return `task_start_sha`. Re-dispatch with corrected brief / Skip 4b for this task / Abort"), and do NOT silently fall back to a SHA range — every fallback considered (`HEAD~1`, `git merge-base HEAD <status.branch>`, `git merge-base HEAD origin/<trunk>`) has a worse failure mode than blocking. If zero commits were made (task aborted before commit), there is no diff to review; skip 4b and let 4a's verification result drive the autonomy policy.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify Step 4b edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "fall back to \`git merge-base HEAD <branch-of-status>\`" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 0 matches (the broken fallback is gone).

Run:
```
grep -nF "treat as a protocol violation: surface a one-line blocker" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in Step 4b.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update Subagent dispatch model row**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the table row starting "| Step C (per-task implementation) |" (currently around line 117). Replace this text:

```
| Step C (per-task implementation) | implementer subagents via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | Sonnet (default) | plan path + current task index + CD-1/2/3/6 brief + relevant spec excerpts | done/blocked + 1–3 lines of evidence + task-start commit SHA |
```

With:

```
| Step C (per-task implementation) | implementer subagents via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | Sonnet (default) | plan path + current task index + CD-1/2/3/6 brief + relevant spec excerpts | done/blocked + 1–3 lines of evidence + **`task_start_sha` (required)** + `tests_passed: bool` + `commands_run: [str]` (Step 4a consumes the latter two; see Task 2) |
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify dispatch row edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "**\`task_start_sha\` (required)**" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in the table.

- [ ] **Step 6: Add operational rule for the implementer-return contract**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the operational rules bullet "**Codex review is asymmetric — never self-review.**" (around line 769). Insert a new bullet immediately AFTER it (before "**Eligibility cache is per-invocation only..."):

```
- **Implementer must return `task_start_sha` (required).** Step C step 2's brief to the implementer subagent (whether dispatched directly or transitively via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`) must include: "Capture `git rev-parse HEAD` BEFORE any work; return it as `task_start_sha` in your final report. This is required, not optional — the orchestrator's Step 4b (Codex review) and Step 4c (worktree integrity) both depend on it." If the implementer omits it, Step 4b blocks (see Step 4b process step 1).
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Verify operational rule edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "**Implementer must return \`task_start_sha\` (required).**" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in the operational rules section.

- [ ] **Step 8: Update CHANGELOG.md**

In `CHANGELOG.md`, find the `[Unreleased]` section. Find the `### Fixed` heading (the most recent one — `[Unreleased]` may have multiple). Add this bullet at the top of that Fixed list:

```
- **Step 4b SHA fallback was a no-op.** When the implementer didn't return `task_start_sha`, Step 4b fell back to `git merge-base HEAD <branch-of-status>`. Since Step C step 1 enforces `current branch == status.branch`, that's `git merge-base HEAD HEAD` = HEAD, giving Codex review an empty diff range. `task_start_sha` is now required in the implementer's return digest; Step 4b blocks with a recoverable AskUserQuestion if it's missing. New operational rule documents the implementer-return contract; subagent dispatch model row in the architecture section calls out `task_start_sha` as required.
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add commands/superflow.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
superflow: fix Step 4b SHA fallback bug; require task_start_sha

Step 4b's `git merge-base HEAD <branch-of-status>` fallback was
effectively `git merge-base HEAD HEAD` = HEAD (Step C step 1 enforces
current branch == status.branch), giving Codex review an empty diff
range. Make task_start_sha required in implementer return; block with
AskUserQuestion when missing instead of silently falling back.

## Task 2: Step 4a × SDD TDD redundancy fix

**Files:**
- Modify: `commands/superflow.md` — Step 4a text (~line 349), Subagent dispatch model row for "Step C (per-task implementation)" (already extended in Task 1, just verify), Operational rules
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md` — `[Unreleased]` Changed section

**Codex:** ok    # bounded text edit + grep verification

- [ ] **Step 1: Re-read spec section 3**

Read spec section "3. Step 4a × SDD TDD redundancy". Approach: implementer return digest already gains `tests_passed` + `commands_run` from Task 1's dispatch-row edit. Step 4a now consumes those fields to skip redundant test re-runs.

- [ ] **Step 2: Replace Step 4a text**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the block starting "**4a — CD-3 verification.**" (around line 349). Replace this text (the first paragraph plus the parallelize-independent-verifiers paragraph):

```
   **4a — CD-3 verification.** Run the task's verification commands (per CD-1) and capture output. Don't claim done without evidence. Capture for use by 4b.

   **Parallelize independent verifiers.** Lint, typecheck, and unit-test commands typically don't share mutable state and should be issued as one parallel Bash batch. Run them sequentially when commands write to the same shared artifacts:
```

With:

```
   **4a — CD-3 verification.** Run the task's verification commands (per CD-1) and capture output for 4b. Trust-but-verify the implementer: read `tests_passed` and `commands_run` from the implementer's return digest (required fields per the dispatch model table) and skip what the implementer already ran cleanly.

   **Decision logic:**
   - If `tests_passed == true` AND every verification command in the plan task is already in `commands_run`: skip 4a's command execution entirely. Activity log entry records `(verify: trusted implementer; <N> commands)`. 4b still consumes the implementer's captured output.
   - If `tests_passed == true` AND the plan task lists additional verification commands the implementer didn't run (lint, typecheck, etc.): run only the *complementary* commands. Activity log records `(verify: trusted implementer for tests + ran <complement>)`.
   - If `tests_passed == false` OR `tests_passed` is missing: run the full verification per CD-1. Activity log records `(verify: full re-run)`. If the implementer claimed done but tests fail on re-run, treat as a protocol violation (block per autonomy policy).

   **Why:** SDD's implementer subagent runs project tests as part of TDD discipline. Re-running them in 4a duplicates token cost and CI time without adding signal. The trust contract is verified by the protocol-violation rule above.

   **Parallelize independent verifiers** (when 4a does run commands). Lint, typecheck, and unit-test commands typically don't share mutable state and should be issued as one parallel Bash batch. Run them sequentially when commands write to the same shared artifacts:
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify Step 4a edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "Trust-but-verify the implementer: read \`tests_passed\`" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in Step 4a.

Run:
```
grep -nF "(verify: trusted implementer; <N> commands)" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in Step 4a's decision logic.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify Task 1's dispatch-row edit covers 4a's needs**

Run:
```
grep -nF "tests_passed: bool\` + \`commands_run: [str]\`" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in the Subagent dispatch model table (set up by Task 1 step 4). If 0 matches, Task 1 step 4 was skipped or reverted — fix before continuing.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add operational rule for the trust contract**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the operational rule "**Implementer must return `task_start_sha` (required).**" added by Task 1. Insert a new bullet immediately AFTER it:

```
- **Implementer-return trust contract.** When the implementer subagent reports `tests_passed: true` and lists `commands_run`, Step 4a trusts the report and skips redundant verification (see Step 4a decision logic). This makes SDD's TDD discipline first-class rather than duplicated work. The contract is enforced by the protocol-violation rule: if the implementer reports `tests_passed: true` but a Step 4a complementary check or a Step 4b Codex review surfaces a test failure, the activity log records the discrepancy and Step C 4d notes it under `## Notes` for human attention.
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Verify operational rule edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "**Implementer-return trust contract.**" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match.

- [ ] **Step 7: Update CHANGELOG.md**

In `CHANGELOG.md`, in the `[Unreleased]` section's `### Changed` heading, add this bullet at the top:

```
- **Step 4a no longer re-runs implementer's tests.** SDD's implementer subagent runs project tests as part of TDD; previously Step 4a ran them again, duplicating token cost and CI time. Implementer return digest now includes `tests_passed: bool` and `commands_run: [str]` (required fields per the dispatch model table); Step 4a skips commands the implementer already ran cleanly and only runs *complementary* checks (lint, typecheck) the implementer didn't. New operational rule documents the trust contract and the protocol-violation handling for false-positive `tests_passed: true`.
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add commands/superflow.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
superflow: Step 4a trusts implementer's TDD report

Implementer return digest gains tests_passed + commands_run; Step 4a
skips redundant test re-runs when the implementer already ran them.
New operational rule documents the trust contract and false-positive
handling.

## Task 3: Persist eligibility cache to disk

**Files:**
- Modify: `commands/superflow.md` — Step C step 1 "Build eligibility cache" paragraph (~line 298), operational rule "Eligibility cache is per-invocation only..." (~line 770), Doctor checks table (~line 588 — adds check #14)
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md` — `[Unreleased]` Added section

**Codex:** ok    # bounded text edit; cache file format defined in spec

- [ ] **Step 1: Re-read spec section 4**

Read spec section "4. Persist eligibility cache". Approach: persist to `<slug>-eligibility-cache.json` sibling to status; load on Step C step 1 entry; invalidate on plan-mtime change. Add doctor check #14 for orphans.

- [ ] **Step 2: Replace Step C step 1 eligibility cache paragraph**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the paragraph starting "**Build eligibility cache.**" (around line 298). Replace this text:

```
   **Build eligibility cache.** When `codex_routing` is `auto` or `manual`, dispatch one Haiku to compute Codex eligibility for every task in the plan (see Step C 3a's checklist for the criteria). Bounded brief: Goal=apply the checklist to each task and emit `{task_idx → {eligible: bool, reason: str, annotated: "ok"|"no"|null}}`, Inputs=full plan task list + plan annotations, Scope=read-only, Return=JSON only — no narration. Cache this in orchestrator memory as `eligibility_cache`. Invalidate (re-dispatch) on the next Step C entry if the plan file's mtime has changed, or if Step 4d edits the plan inline. Never persist to disk. Skip this step entirely when `codex_routing == off`.
```

With:

```
   **Build eligibility cache.** When `codex_routing` is `auto` or `manual`, the cache lives at `<slug>-eligibility-cache.json` (sibling to status, follows the `<slug>-*` sidecar convention). Decision tree for cache load:

   - **Skip entirely** when `codex_routing == off`.
   - **Cache file missing** → dispatch one Haiku (see brief below); write `<slug>-eligibility-cache.json`; load into orchestrator memory as `eligibility_cache`.
   - **Cache file present, `cache.mtime > plan.mtime`** → load JSON from disk into `eligibility_cache`; skip Haiku dispatch.
   - **Cache file present, `plan.mtime >= cache.mtime`** → dispatch Haiku, overwrite cache file, load result.
   - When Step 4d edits the plan inline, also `touch` the plan file so the mtime invariant holds for the next Step C entry's cache check.

   **Cache file shape** (JSON):
   ```json
   {
     "plan_path": "docs/superpowers/plans/<slug>.md",
     "plan_mtime_at_compute": "2026-05-01T14:32:00Z",
     "generated_at": "2026-05-01T14:32:01Z",
     "tasks": [
       {"idx": 1, "name": "...", "eligible": true,  "reason": "...", "annotated": null},
       {"idx": 2, "name": "...", "eligible": false, "reason": "...", "annotated": "no"}
     ]
   }
   ```

   **Bounded brief for the Haiku** (when dispatched): Goal=apply the Step C 3a checklist to each task and emit `{task_idx → {eligible: bool, reason: str, annotated: "ok"|"no"|null}}`. Inputs=full plan task list + plan annotations (per the `**Codex:**` syntax — see Step C 3a). Scope=read-only. Return=JSON only — no narration.

   **Why persist:** the cache is a pure function of plan-file content. Recomputing on every wakeup (~10 wakeups for a 30-task plan under `loose`) burns Haiku calls for no signal change. Disk persistence with mtime invalidation costs one stat per Step C entry.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify Step C step 1 cache edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "**Cache file missing**" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in Step C step 1.

Run:
```
grep -nF "Never persist to disk" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 0 matches (the old "never persist" claim is gone).

- [ ] **Step 4: Update operational rule "Eligibility cache..."**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the operational rules bullet starting "**Eligibility cache is per-invocation only; never persisted to disk.**" (around line 770). Replace this entire bullet:

```
- **Eligibility cache is per-invocation only; never persisted to disk.** Step C step 1 builds `eligibility_cache`. Re-dispatch on plan-file mtime change, or after Step 4d edits the plan inline. Keeps per-task routing O(1) lookups instead of LLM-shaped reasoning.
```

With:

```
- **Eligibility cache persists to `<slug>-eligibility-cache.json`.** Step C step 1 loads from disk when `cache.mtime > plan.mtime`; dispatches Haiku otherwise. Step 4d's plan edits `touch` the plan file to invalidate. Per-task routing stays O(1) at lookup; the Haiku dispatch happens once per plan-file change, not per Step C entry. Doctor check #14 flags orphan caches.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify operational rule edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "Never persisted to disk" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 0 matches.

Run:
```
grep -nF "**Eligibility cache persists to" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match.

- [ ] **Step 6: Add Doctor check #14 row**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the doctor checks table. The last row is currently #13 ("Orphan telemetry file..."). Add this new row immediately after the #13 row (before the table-closing blank line):

```
| 14 | **Orphan eligibility cache** — `<slug>-eligibility-cache.json` exists with no sibling `<slug>-status.md`. (The cache is a sidecar of an active plan; it must always have a base status file.) | Warning | Suggest moving to `<config.archive_path>/<date>/`. No auto-fix. |
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Verify Doctor check edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "**Orphan eligibility cache**" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in the doctor checks table.

- [ ] **Step 8: Update CHANGELOG.md**

In `CHANGELOG.md`, in the `[Unreleased]` section's `### Added` heading, add this bullet near the top (after existing CC-1/CC-2 entries to keep chronological-ish order):

```
- **Eligibility cache persists across wakeups.** Previously rebuilt every Step C entry via Haiku dispatch (~10 redundant calls per long run). Now written to `<slug>-eligibility-cache.json` (sibling to status), loaded on subsequent entries when `cache.mtime > plan.mtime`. Plan edits via Step 4d `touch` the plan to invalidate. New doctor check #14 catches orphan cache files. Operational rule updated; "never persisted to disk" claim retired.
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add commands/superflow.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
superflow: persist eligibility cache to disk across wakeups

Cache lives at <slug>-eligibility-cache.json sibling to status; loaded
when cache.mtime > plan.mtime, dispatched only on plan-file change.
Eliminates ~10 redundant Haiku dispatches per long run. Doctor check
#14 catches orphan cache files. Operational rule updated.

## Task 4: Document plan annotation schema (`**Codex:** ok|no`)

**Files:**
- Modify: `commands/superflow.md` — Step C 3a Plan annotations subsection (~line 325), Step C step 1 cache builder brief (extended in Task 3 — verify), Step B2 brief (~line 248)
- Modify: `README.md` — add new "Plan annotations" subsection after the Configuration section
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md` — `[Unreleased]` Added section

**Codex:** ok    # documentation + minor logic linkage

- [ ] **Step 1: Re-read spec section 5**

Read spec section "5. Plan annotation schema documentation". Approach: define annotation as `**Codex:** ok|no` line in per-task `**Files:**` block; document with example; thread through the cache builder brief and the writing-plans brief in Step B2.

- [ ] **Step 2: Replace Step C 3a "Plan annotations" subsection**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the block starting "**Plan annotations** (override the heuristic when present, recorded in cache as `annotated: \"ok\"|\"no\"`):" (around line 325). Replace this entire block:

```
    **Plan annotations** (override the heuristic when present, recorded in cache as `annotated: "ok"|"no"`):
    - `codex: ok` in the task metadata → delegate (`eligible: true`, `annotated: "ok"`).
    - `codex: no` → never delegate; run inline (`eligible: false`, `annotated: "no"`).
```

With:

```
    **Plan annotations** (override the heuristic when present, recorded in cache as `annotated: "ok"|"no"`):

    Annotations live as a `**Codex:**` line in the per-task `**Files:**` block of the plan. Concrete syntax:

    ```markdown
    ### Task 3: Add memory adapter

    **Files:**
    - Create: `src/memory/adapter.py`
    - Test: `tests/memory/test_adapter.py`

    **Codex:** ok    # eligible for Codex auto-delegation under codex_routing=auto
    ```

    Or:

    ```markdown
    **Codex:** no    # never delegate; requires understanding of the storage layer
    ```

    Effect on the eligibility cache:
    - `**Codex:** ok` → `eligible: true`, `annotated: "ok"` (overrides the heuristic; delegate even for tasks the checklist would reject).
    - `**Codex:** no` → `eligible: false`, `annotated: "no"` (never delegate; run inline).
    - No annotation → fall through to the heuristic checklist above; `annotated: null`.

    The eligibility-cache builder Haiku (Step C step 1) parses these annotations: scan each task block's `**Files:**` section for a following `**Codex:**` line; record the annotation alongside the heuristic decision.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify Step C 3a annotation edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "Annotations live as a \`**Codex:**\` line in the per-task" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in Step C 3a.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update Step B2 brief to mention annotations**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the block starting "### Step B2 — Plan" (around line 246). Replace this text:

```
After brainstorming returns, invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` against the spec. It will produce `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. Brief plan-writing with **CD-1 + CD-6**.
```

With:

```
After brainstorming returns, invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` against the spec. It will produce `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. Brief plan-writing with **CD-1 + CD-6**, plus this annotation guidance:

> When you judge a task as obviously well-suited for Codex (≤ 3 files, unambiguous, has known verification commands, no design judgment) or obviously unsuited (requires understanding broader system context, design tradeoffs, or files outside the stated scope), add a `**Codex:** ok` or `**Codex:** no` line in the per-task `**Files:**` block. See the Plan annotations subsection in Step C 3a for the exact syntax. The orchestrator's eligibility cache parses these as overrides on the heuristic checklist.

Plans without annotations behave exactly as before (heuristic-only). Annotations are an authoring aid; they're never required.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify Step B2 edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "When you judge a task as obviously well-suited for Codex" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in Step B2.

- [ ] **Step 6: Verify Task 3's cache-builder brief mentions annotations**

Run:
```
grep -nF "plan annotations (per the \`**Codex:**\` syntax — see Step C 3a)" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in Step C step 1's eligibility-cache paragraph (set up by Task 3 step 2). If 0 matches, Task 3 step 2 was skipped — verify and rewrite.

- [ ] **Step 7: Add "Plan annotations" subsection to README.md**

Read `README.md`. Find the line "## Status file (the source of truth)" (around line 305). Insert a new section IMMEDIATELY BEFORE that line:

```markdown
## Plan annotations

Tasks in `/superflow`-generated plans can carry an optional `**Codex:**` annotation that overrides the eligibility heuristic for Codex routing:

```markdown
### Task 3: Add memory adapter

**Files:**
- Create: `src/memory/adapter.py`
- Test: `tests/memory/test_adapter.py`

**Codex:** ok    # eligible for Codex auto-delegation under codex_routing=auto
```

| Annotation | Effect on eligibility cache |
|---|---|
| `**Codex:** ok` | `eligible: true`, `annotated: "ok"` — delegate even if the heuristic would reject |
| `**Codex:** no` | `eligible: false`, `annotated: "no"` — never delegate |
| (no annotation) | fall through to the heuristic checklist; `annotated: null` |

Plans authored via `/superflow`'s Step B2 get this guidance baked into the `writing-plans` brief: the planner adds `**Codex:** ok` for obviously well-bounded tasks (≤ 3 files, unambiguous, known verification) and `**Codex:** no` for tasks that require broader context. Plans without annotations behave exactly as before — annotations are an aid, never required.

```

- [ ] **Step 8: Verify README edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "## Plan annotations" README.md
```
Expected: 1 match (the new subsection).

Run:
```
grep -c "## " README.md
```
Expected: a number ≥ 14 (one more than the pre-edit count). Sanity check that the new section landed.

- [ ] **Step 9: Update CHANGELOG.md**

In `CHANGELOG.md`, in the `[Unreleased]` section's `### Added` heading, add this bullet:

```
- **Plan annotation schema documented.** `**Codex:** ok|no` lines in per-task `**Files:**` blocks override the eligibility heuristic for Codex routing. Documented in `commands/superflow.md` Step C 3a (with concrete syntax example), threaded through Step C step 1's cache-builder brief, and surfaced in Step B2's brief to `superpowers:writing-plans` so new plans gain annotations when the planner judges tasks obviously suited or unsuited. New "Plan annotations" subsection in README.md. Pre-existing plans without annotations behave exactly as before (heuristic-only). The eligibility cache's `annotated` branch is no longer dead code.
```

- [ ] **Step 10: Commit**

```bash
git add commands/superflow.md README.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
superflow: document **Codex:** ok|no plan annotation schema

Annotations live as a **Codex:** line in the per-task **Files:** block
of the plan. Documented in commands/superflow.md (Step C 3a syntax,
Step C step 1 cache builder brief, Step B2 writing-plans brief) and
README.md (new Plan annotations subsection). Eligibility cache's
annotated branch is no longer dead code.

## Task 5: Gated permissiveness defaults

**Files:**
- Modify: `commands/superflow.md` — Step C step 3 (~line 307), Step 4b decision matrix gated case (~line 392), Configuration schema codex block (~line 715)
- Modify: `README.md` — Configuration section codex block (~line 273), Useful flag combinations table (~line 217)
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md` — `[Unreleased]` Changed section

**Codex:** ok    # multi-file but bounded; spec defines exact behavior

- [ ] **Step 1: Re-read spec section 2**

Read spec section "2. Gated permissiveness defaults". Approach: under `gated`, honor pre-configured Codex auto-routing silently; auto-accept clean and low-only Codex reviews silently. New config keys `codex.confirm_auto_routing: false` and `codex.review_prompt_at: "medium"` for opting back into the chatty behavior.

- [ ] **Step 2: Replace Step C step 3 `gated` bullet**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the bullet starting "- **`gated`** — before each task" (around line 307). Replace this text:

```
   - **`gated`** — before each task, call `AskUserQuestion(continue / skip-this-task / stop)`. Honor the answer. If `codex_routing == auto`, expand the question to `(continue inline / continue via Codex / skip / stop)` so the user can override the auto-route. Under `codex_routing == manual`, do NOT expand here — Step 3a's per-task `AskUserQuestion` already handles routing, so combining would double-prompt.
```

With:

```
   - **`gated`** — before each task, call `AskUserQuestion(continue / skip-this-task / stop)`. Honor the answer. **Routing decisions made via the eligibility cache (under `codex_routing == auto`) are honored silently** — the per-task question is NOT expanded with a Codex-override option, since the user pre-configured auto-routing and the activity log records every decision post-hoc. Users who want the legacy expanded prompt set `codex.confirm_auto_routing: true` in `.superflow.yaml`; in that case the question expands to `(continue inline / continue via Codex / skip / stop)`. Under `codex_routing == manual`, do NOT expand here — Step 3a's per-task `AskUserQuestion` already handles routing.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify Step C step 3 edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "Routing decisions made via the eligibility cache" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in Step C step 3.

Run:
```
grep -nF "expand the question to \`(continue inline / continue via Codex / skip / stop)\` so the user can override the auto-route" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 0 matches (the old expand-by-default text is gone).

- [ ] **Step 4: Replace Step 4b decision matrix `gated` bullet**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the line "- **`gated`** — present findings via `AskUserQuestion`" (around line 392, in the Step 4b decision matrix). Replace this text:

```
      - **`gated`** — present findings via `AskUserQuestion` → `Accept / Fix and re-review (rerun inline with findings as briefing; capped at config.codex.review_max_fix_iterations) / Accept anyway / Stop`.
```

With:

```
      - **`gated`** — auto-accept silently when severity is `clean` or strictly below `config.codex.review_prompt_at` (default `"medium"`). Activity log records the auto-accept; `## Notes` is not polluted (clean and low-only reviews don't need notes per Step 4b step 5). When severity is at or above the threshold, present findings via `AskUserQuestion` → `Accept / Fix and re-review (rerun inline with findings as briefing; capped at config.codex.review_max_fix_iterations) / Accept anyway / Stop`. Users who want every review prompted set `codex.review_prompt_at: "low"` in `.superflow.yaml`.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify Step 4b decision matrix edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "auto-accept silently when severity is \`clean\` or strictly below" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in Step 4b.

- [ ] **Step 6: Update Configuration schema codex block**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the `codex:` block in the Configuration schema (around line 715). Replace this text:

```
codex:
  routing: auto              # off | auto | manual — who executes a task
  review: off                # off | on — Codex reviews diffs from inline-completed tasks
  review_diff_under_full: false  # if true, even autonomy=full pauses to show Codex output
  max_files_for_auto: 3      # eligibility heuristic threshold for `auto` routing
  review_max_fix_iterations: 2  # cap on "fix and re-review" retries before bailing
```

With:

```
codex:
  routing: auto              # off | auto | manual — who executes a task
  review: off                # off | on — Codex reviews diffs from inline-completed tasks
  review_diff_under_full: false  # if true, even autonomy=full pauses to show Codex output
  max_files_for_auto: 3      # eligibility heuristic threshold for `auto` routing
  review_max_fix_iterations: 2  # cap on "fix and re-review" retries before bailing
  confirm_auto_routing: false  # under `gated`, prompt per-task to confirm auto-routing decisions
                               # (default false: honor cache silently; activity log records every decision)
                               # set true to restore the legacy expanded per-task prompt
  review_prompt_at: medium   # under `gated`, severity threshold at which Codex review findings prompt
                             # values: low | medium | high | never
                             # default `medium` (auto-accept clean and low-only; prompt at medium+)
                             # set `low` to prompt on every non-clean review; set `never` to auto-accept all
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Verify Configuration schema edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "confirm_auto_routing: false" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in the YAML schema.

Run:
```
grep -nF "review_prompt_at: medium" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match.

- [ ] **Step 8: Update README.md Configuration section codex block**

Read `README.md`. Find the `codex:` block in the Configuration YAML (around line 273). Replace this text:

```yaml
# Codex routing + review
codex:
  routing: auto              # off | auto | manual — who executes a task
  review: off                # off | on — Codex reviews diffs from inline-completed tasks
  review_diff_under_full: false
  max_files_for_auto: 3
  review_max_fix_iterations: 2
```

With:

```yaml
# Codex routing + review
codex:
  routing: auto              # off | auto | manual — who executes a task
  review: off                # off | on — Codex reviews diffs from inline-completed tasks
  review_diff_under_full: false
  max_files_for_auto: 3
  review_max_fix_iterations: 2
  confirm_auto_routing: false  # under `gated`, prompt per-task to confirm auto-routing
                               # default false: honor eligibility cache silently
                               # set true to restore legacy expanded prompt
  review_prompt_at: medium   # under `gated`, severity threshold at which review findings prompt
                             # low | medium | high | never (default medium)
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Verify README.md Configuration edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "confirm_auto_routing: false" README.md
```
Expected: 1 match.

Run:
```
grep -nF "review_prompt_at: medium" README.md
```
Expected: 1 match.

- [ ] **Step 10: Update README.md "Useful flag combinations" table**

In `README.md`, find the row in the Useful flag combinations table starting "| `/superflow <topic>` | Default:" (around line 219). Replace that row:

```
| `/superflow <topic>` | Default: `--autonomy=gated`, codex routing from config (default `auto`), no review. Each task gates on user input; small well-defined tasks may auto-route to Codex. |
```

With:

```
| `/superflow <topic>` | Default: `--autonomy=gated`, codex routing from config (default `auto`), no review. Per-task `(continue / skip / stop)` gate; auto-routing decisions execute silently (no per-task Codex confirmation prompt — set `codex.confirm_auto_routing: true` for the legacy chatty behavior). |
```

Then find the row starting "| `/loop /superflow <topic> --autonomy=loose --codex-review=on` |" (around line 221). Replace that row:

```
| `/loop /superflow <topic> --autonomy=loose --codex-review=on` | Same long run, but Codex reviews each inline (Claude/Sonnet) task's diff before it counts as done. Medium findings go to `## Notes`; high findings block. |
```

With:

```
| `/loop /superflow <topic> --autonomy=loose --codex-review=on` | Same long run, but Codex reviews each inline (Claude/Sonnet) task's diff before it counts as done. Under `loose`: low/clean → silent accept; medium → `## Notes`; high → block. (Same behavior under `gated` for non-prompting severities — auto-accepted silently below `codex.review_prompt_at`, default `medium`.) |
```

- [ ] **Step 11: Verify README.md flag-combinations edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "auto-routing decisions execute silently" README.md
```
Expected: 1 match.

Run:
```
grep -nF "Each task gates on user input; small well-defined tasks may auto-route to Codex." README.md
```
Expected: 0 matches (the old phrasing is gone).

- [ ] **Step 12: Update CHANGELOG.md**

In `CHANGELOG.md`, in the `[Unreleased]` section's `### Changed` heading, add this bullet at the top:

```
- **Gated mode no longer prompts on pre-configured Codex automation.** Under `--autonomy=gated`: (a) auto-routing decisions from the eligibility cache execute silently — the per-task question is no longer expanded with a Codex-override option when `codex_routing == auto`. (b) Codex review findings auto-accept silently when severity is below `config.codex.review_prompt_at` (default `"medium"`); only medium+ findings prompt. Activity log still tags every decision so the user sees what happened post-hoc, just doesn't gate on it. **Behavior change** — users who want the legacy chatty behavior set `codex.confirm_auto_routing: true` and `codex.review_prompt_at: "low"`. README config + Useful flag combinations table updated to document the new defaults.
```

- [ ] **Step 13: Commit**

```bash
git add commands/superflow.md README.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
superflow: gated mode honors pre-configured Codex automation silently

Under --autonomy=gated: auto-routing decisions execute silently (no
per-task Codex-override prompt); Codex review findings auto-accept
when below codex.review_prompt_at (default medium). Activity log
still tags every decision. New config keys confirm_auto_routing and
review_prompt_at let users restore legacy chatty behavior. README
config + flag-combinations table updated.

## Task 6: Step B0 trunk-branch warning on "Stay"

**Files:**
- Modify: `commands/superflow.md` — Step B0 step 3 (~line 230)
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md` — `[Unreleased]` Changed section

**Codex:** ok    # tiny targeted edit

- [ ] **Step 1: Re-read spec section 6**

Read spec section "6. Step B0 worktree warning when "Stay" lands on trunk". Approach: when current branch is in `config.trunk_branches`, the "Stay in current worktree" option's description gains the SDD-refuses-trunk warning.

- [ ] **Step 2: Replace Step B0 step 3 options block**

In `commands/superflow.md`, find the block starting "3. **Present the choice via `AskUserQuestion`** with options reflecting the recommendation. Always include:" (around line 229). Replace this text:

```
3. **Present the choice via `AskUserQuestion`** with options reflecting the recommendation. Always include:
   - "Stay in current worktree (`<branch>` at `<path>`)"
   - One option per existing matching worktree, if any: "Use existing worktree (`<branch>` at `<path>`)"
   - "Create new worktree" (this invokes `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` to do it properly)
   - Mark the recommended option first with "(Recommended)" and a one-line reason in the description (e.g. "current branch is main — isolate this work").
```

With:

```
3. **Present the choice via `AskUserQuestion`** with options reflecting the recommendation. Always include:
   - "Stay in current worktree (`<branch>` at `<path>`)"
     - When `<branch>` is in `config.trunk_branches`, the option's description text gains a warning: `"(Note: superpowers:subagent-driven-development will refuse to start on this branch without explicit consent — choose Create new if you'll execute via subagents.)"` This surfaces the SDD constraint at the worktree-decision point rather than as a surprise at Step C. When `<branch>` is non-trunk, no warning.
   - One option per existing matching worktree, if any: "Use existing worktree (`<branch>` at `<path>`)"
   - "Create new worktree" (this invokes `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` to do it properly)
   - Mark the recommended option first with "(Recommended)" and a one-line reason in the description (e.g. "current branch is main — isolate this work").
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify Step B0 edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "subagent-driven-development will refuse to start on this branch" commands/superflow.md
```
Expected: 1 match in Step B0 step 3.

- [ ] **Step 4: Update CHANGELOG.md**

In `CHANGELOG.md`, in the `[Unreleased]` section's `### Changed` heading, add this bullet:

```
- **Step B0 surfaces SDD's trunk-branch refusal at decision time.** When the user is on a branch in `config.trunk_branches` (default `[main, master, trunk, dev, develop]`), the "Stay in current worktree" option's description now warns that `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` will refuse to start there. Previously the user found out at Step C (after the worktree decision was supposedly settled). Non-trunk branches are unchanged — no warning shown.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add commands/superflow.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
superflow: Step B0 warns on Stay when current branch is trunk

The "Stay in current worktree" option's description now flags that
subagent-driven-development will refuse to start on trunk branches
(main/master/etc.). Surfaces the SDD constraint at worktree-decision
time rather than as a surprise at Step C.

## Task 7: Cross-cutting verification + final commit

**Files:**
- Read-only: all modified files from Tasks 1–6
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md` — clean up duplicate `### Added` blocks if any (the original CHANGELOG had two "### Added" sections in `[Unreleased]`; sanity-check)

**Codex:** no    # cross-file reasoning, coherence checks across multiple sections; needs judgment

- [ ] **Step 1: Cross-reference check — every new config key documented in three places**

For each new config key, verify it appears in the YAML schema in `commands/superflow.md`, in the README config block, and is mentioned in at least one CHANGELOG entry.

Run:
```
for key in "confirm_auto_routing" "review_prompt_at"; do
  echo "=== $key ==="
  echo "commands/superflow.md:"; grep -nF "$key" commands/superflow.md
  echo "README.md:";              grep -nF "$key" README.md
  echo "CHANGELOG.md:";           grep -nF "$key" CHANGELOG.md
  echo
done
```

Expected: each `===` block shows ≥ 1 match in each of the three files. If any file shows 0 matches for a key, that key was missed in one of the previous tasks — open the file, find the right place, add it.

- [ ] **Step 2: Cross-reference check — every changed Step in commands/superflow.md has a CHANGELOG entry**

Confirm each of the six changes has a corresponding `[Unreleased]` CHANGELOG entry under the right heading:

Run:
```
echo "=== CHANGELOG [Unreleased] entries for this pass ==="
awk '/^## \[Unreleased\]/{p=1} /^## \[/ && !/Unreleased/{p=0} p' CHANGELOG.md | head -100
```

Visually scan the output. Confirm that you see entries (not exhaustive, just one for each):
1. **Fixed:** "Step 4b SHA fallback was a no-op" (Task 1)
2. **Changed:** "Step 4a no longer re-runs implementer's tests" (Task 2)
3. **Added:** "Eligibility cache persists across wakeups" (Task 3)
4. **Added:** "Plan annotation schema documented" (Task 4)
5. **Changed:** "Gated mode no longer prompts on pre-configured Codex automation" (Task 5)
6. **Changed:** "Step B0 surfaces SDD's trunk-branch refusal" (Task 6)

If any are missing, find the task that should have added it and check whether step "Update CHANGELOG.md" was completed.

- [ ] **Step 3: Mental end-to-end trace under new gated defaults**

Walk through one /superflow invocation under `--autonomy=gated --codex=auto --codex-review=on` mentally and confirm no surprise prompts:

- Step C step 1: eligibility cache loads from disk (or builds + persists if missing) — no user prompt.
- Step C step 3: `gated` asks `(continue / skip / stop)` for the next task — does NOT expand to Codex options (Task 5 step 2). User sees one prompt per task, not two.
- Step C 3a: cache says `eligible: true` → Codex dispatched silently.
- Step C 4a: implementer trusted; tests not re-run if `tests_passed: true` (Task 2 step 2).
- Step C 4b: Codex review returns `clean` or `low` → auto-accepted silently per `review_prompt_at` (Task 5 step 4). Returns `medium+` → user prompted.
- Step C 4d: status updated, activity log entry includes routing + review tags so user sees post-hoc.

Cite: walked through the trace, no surprise prompts for pre-configured automation. If any step still prompts unexpectedly, the corresponding task missed a fix — re-open it.

- [ ] **Step 4: Bash syntax check on hooks**

Run:
```
bash -n hooks/superflow-telemetry.sh && echo "telemetry hook syntax-clean"
```

Expected: `telemetry hook syntax-clean`. (This pass didn't touch the hook, but the check is a safety net for future sessions that might.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` heading structure isn't broken**

The original `CHANGELOG.md` had two `### Added` blocks under `[Unreleased]` (verify by inspection). After Tasks 3 and 4, both Added entries went to "the most recent ### Added heading." This may have produced an unbalanced structure. Inspect:

Run:
```
awk '/^## \[Unreleased\]/{p=1} /^## \[/ && !/Unreleased/{p=0} p' CHANGELOG.md | grep -nE "^### " | head -20
```

Expected pattern: one `### Added`, one `### Changed`, one `### Fixed`, possibly a second `### Added`. If two `### Added` blocks exist and the entries from Tasks 3/4 went to one of them, that's fine — Keep a Changelog allows it. Don't restructure unless the file is genuinely broken (e.g., two consecutive `### Added` headings with no entries between them, or content that won't render).

- [ ] **Step 6: Final commit (verification metadata)**

If Steps 1–5 surfaced any issues that required follow-up edits, commit them now with:

```bash
git add commands/superflow.md README.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
superflow: small-fixes pass — final verification cleanup

Cross-cutting checks after Tasks 1-6: verified config keys documented
in all three locations, CHANGELOG entries land under the right
headings, and the new gated defaults produce no surprise prompts on
mental end-to-end trace.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

If Steps 1–5 found nothing to fix, skip the commit; the small-fixes pass is complete with the six per-task commits from Tasks 1–6.

- [ ] **Step 7: Report back**

Summarize:
- How many tasks landed (should be 6 + optional 7 + Task 8 below).
- Each commit SHA.
- Any verification issues that surfaced and how they were resolved.
- Note that Task 8 (version bump) follows.

---

## Task 8: Bump version to v0.2.0

**Files:**
- Modify: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `"version"` field
- Modify: `README.md` — "## Project status" section ("v0.1 release" → "v0.2 release")
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md` — rename `[Unreleased]` heading to `[0.2.0] — 2026-05-01`; insert a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` block above it

**Codex:** ok    # mechanical version bump across three files

- [ ] **Step 1: Bump plugin.json version**

Read `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Find the line `"version": "0.1.0",`. Edit it to `"version": "0.2.0",` (keep the trailing comma; preserve the surrounding JSON formatting).

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify plugin.json edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF '"version": "0.2.0"' .claude-plugin/plugin.json
```
Expected: 1 match.

Run:
```
grep -nF '"version": "0.1.0"' .claude-plugin/plugin.json
```
Expected: 0 matches.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update README.md project status**

Read `README.md`. Find the line "This is a v0.1 release." in the "## Project status" section. Replace:

```
This is a v0.1 release. The orchestration logic is stable and used in real Petabit Scale workflows, but expect the schema and flag surface to evolve as edge cases surface. Breaking changes will be called out in the changelog and gated behind a `--legacy` flag where reasonable.
```

With:

```
This is a v0.2 release. The orchestration logic is stable and used in real Petabit Scale workflows. v0.2 lands the first behavior-changing pass since v0.1: gated mode no longer prompts on pre-configured Codex automation by default (see CHANGELOG `[0.2.0]`). Expect the schema and flag surface to keep evolving; breaking changes are called out in the changelog and gated behind a `--legacy` flag where reasonable.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify README edit**

Run:
```
grep -nF "This is a v0.2 release." README.md
```
Expected: 1 match.

Run:
```
grep -nF "This is a v0.1 release." README.md
```
Expected: 0 matches.

- [ ] **Step 5: Cut CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` → `[0.2.0]`**

Read `CHANGELOG.md`. The current `[Unreleased]` section now contains all the entries added by Tasks 1–6 plus any from Task 7. Rename the heading and insert a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` block ABOVE it.

Find this exact string (the only occurrence):

```
## [Unreleased]
```

Replace with:

```
## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-01
```

This preserves all the section content (Added/Changed/Fixed) under the new `[0.2.0]` heading, and leaves a clean empty `[Unreleased]` for future work.

- [ ] **Step 6: Verify CHANGELOG edit**

Run:
```
grep -nE "^## \[" CHANGELOG.md | head -5
```
Expected: first three matches show `## [Unreleased]`, `## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-01`, and `## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-01` (in that order, top to bottom).

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add .claude-plugin/plugin.json README.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
release: v0.2.0

CHANGELOG [Unreleased] cut to [0.2.0]; plugin.json and README project
status updated. v0.2 lands the small-fixes pass — see [0.2.0] in
CHANGELOG for the full breakdown.

)"
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Final report**

Summarize the v0.2.0 release:
- Total commits in this pass (Tasks 1–8).
- Net file changes (`git diff main..HEAD --stat`).
- Suggest invoking `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` to merge to main or open a PR.
